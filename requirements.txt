#### How it works:
#1. **Face Encoding**: The system creates a biometric template of your face using advanced facial recognition algorithms
#2. **Face Detection**: Uses Dlib's facial recognition which is based on deep learning
#3. **Face Matching**: Compares detected faces with your stored biometric template
#4. **Recording**: Automatically starts when your face is detected and stops when you leave
